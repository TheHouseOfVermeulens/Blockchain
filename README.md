In this repo you'll find some Blockchain code samples of my recent blockchain projects including where I did the following:
 
• Examined blockchain structures to build robust, temper-proof transaction ledgers. Continued my examination on how blockchains can be secured against double spending attacks and the consensus protocol that is followed when more than one party holds the same transaction ledger. 

• Code implemented of blockchain in R programming language.

• Explored the different approaches to anonymity in blockchain by introducing Zcash to demonstrate zero-knowledge proofs and their implications for anonymity. 

• Examined two smart contract platforms, Ethereum and EOS, and their approaches to decentralized applications.

• Examined Smart contracts and how Ethereum achieves smart contract capabilities. 

• Used Truffle, Ganache, and MetaMask to deploy smart contracts onto a test network and elaborated on this process by deploying smart contracts to a live network. 

• Examined the use of smart contracts in the Ethereum environment after taken into account when developing smart contracts.

• Used C# to create and call Ethereum smart contracts 

• Developed, deployed, and interacted with smart contracts using Truffle, Ganache, and MetaMast

• Solidity language fundamentals and its applications

• Examined gas and efficiency as major considerations when developing smart contracts due to memory and processing power constraints in the Ethereum network.

• Examined the internal structure of the Ethereum network and implemented security. 

• Illustrated key concepts in smart contracts including governance, languages, and standards

• Code implementation of smart contracts in C#

Recent research includes:
